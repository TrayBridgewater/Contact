This code was written for the "Soft Test Automation & QA" course as SNHU. 

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
One can ensure that their code is functional and secure by implementing a very thorough testing regime, preferably including automated unit testing designed in a unit testing suite such as JUnit. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
One should interpret user needs by meeting with the different users and project stakeholders and "translating" them into concrete and specific user requirements that can be used to guide the software development process and design a high-quality testing regime. 

How do I approach designing software?
Software is functional: it is supposed to solve problems. When designing software, one should do so specifically around what users have expressed they need and desire from the software. Always use the user needs as your guiding star.
